                Hi, I'm <span className='text-secondary'>Muhammed Salah K&nbsp;T</span>, a dynamic software developer with a strong foundation in C/C++, Python, and expertise in React, PHP-Laravel, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I've played a pivotal role at PIKIT LLP, contributing to the maintenance of a food delivery app and leading impactful projects like developing a website for a Blood Donors organization. My passion extends to graphic designâ€”crafting compelling posters, flyers, brochures, and logos. Beyond coding and design, I'm also a mentor, running Python tuition sessions and guiding others in web development.

                In addition to my tech journey, I'm on a learning path exploring Psychology, NLP, Hypnosis, Enneagram, and CBT. Join me at the intersection of technology and creativity, where I continue to push boundaries and make a meaningful impact. Let's create something extraordinary together!
